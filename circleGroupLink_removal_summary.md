// Summary of circleGroupLink removal from MemberManagement component
// This documents what was removed and why

/*
REMOVED FUNCTIONALITY:
=====================

1. getCircleGroupLink() function
   - This function was automatically creating WhatsApp group links
   - It would fetch the circle's WhatsApp link from the cohort's circles array
   - It handled both old format (string) and new format (object) circles

2. circleGroupLink field from MainMember type
   - Removed from TypeScript interface
   - No longer stored in database or form state

3. circleGroupLink from form state
   - Removed from mainMemberForm initialization
   - Removed from handleEdit function
   - Removed from resetMainMemberForm function

4. circleGroupLink from member creation/update
   - Removed from handleMainMemberSubmit (both edit and create)
   - Removed from handlePromoteToMain
   - Removed from handleBulkPromoteToMain
   - Removed from CSV upload (handleBulkCreateMainMembers)

5. circleGroupLink from form UI
   - Removed Circle Group Link input field
   - Removed automatic population logic
   - Removed circleGroupLink updates when circle selection changes

6. circleGroupLink from CSV processing
   - Removed circleGroupLink variable and assignment logic
   - Simplified circle assignment to just store circle number

WHAT REMAINS:
=============

1. Circle number assignment still works
   - Users can still select circles from dropdown
   - Circle numbers are stored as just the number (e.g., "14")
   - Display still shows "Circle 14" for user-friendly interface

2. Circle selection functionality
   - getAvailableCircles() function still works
   - Circle dropdown still populates correctly
   - Circle assignment in CSV upload still works

3. All other member management features
   - Member creation, editing, deletion
   - CSV upload and bulk operations
   - Promotion from taster to main members

BENEFITS OF REMOVAL:
===================

1. Simplified data model
   - No redundant circle group link storage
   - Circle links are already available in cohort.circles array

2. Reduced complexity
   - No automatic link generation logic
   - No form field management for circleGroupLink
   - Cleaner member data structure

3. Better data consistency
   - Circle links come from single source (cohort.circles)
   - No risk of stale or incorrect circle group links
   - Easier to maintain circle link updates

4. Performance improvement
   - No unnecessary link generation on every form interaction
   - Smaller member objects
   - Faster form processing

USAGE AFTER REMOVAL:
===================

To get a circle's WhatsApp group link, use:
1. Get the member's circle_number (e.g., "14")
2. Get the member's current_cohort_id
3. Find the cohort in cohorts array
4. Access cohort.circles[parseInt(circle_number) - 1]
5. Extract circle_whatsapp_link from the circle object

Example:
```javascript
const getCircleLink = (member, cohorts) => {
  const cohort = cohorts.find(c => c.id === member.current_cohort_id)
  if (cohort && cohort.circles && member.circle_number) {
    const circleIndex = parseInt(member.circle_number) - 1
    const circle = cohort.circles[circleIndex]
    return circle?.circle_whatsapp_link || ''
  }
  return ''
}
```
